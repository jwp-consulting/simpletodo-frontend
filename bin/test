# This is similar to running npm run check, except that it attempts to be more
# "best-effort".
# The difference is that if eslint fails, it will try to fix and run prettier.
# For example, for unused imports, eslint will first clear the lines, and
# then any remaining whitespace will be cleaned up by prettier.
# For good measure, we check one more time after a potential cleanup.
