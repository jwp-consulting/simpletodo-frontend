# Internationalization

## Terminology

### Message ID

An ID used to identify a specific message, regardless of locale. Examples are
as follows.

- `settings.title`
- `form.name.label`
- `landing.greeting.heading`

### Message

A message is some form of readable information communicated to a user. A
message exists by virtue of being mentioned using a message ID. A message
exists egardless of locale, but depending on the locale it might not have been
translated yet. A message can depend on values, such as time, date, and
numbers, but it itself does not contain any information on how to process and
display these.

### Locale

A locale is a set of parameters specifying a user's preferred language, region
and further specifiers used to show a user interface.

Examples for locales:

- `fr_BE`: Belgium French with Euro currency

### Localization

Adjusting information, such as messages, so that users of a specific locale
can understand them sufficiently. If something has been adjusted for a locale,
it will be called _localized_.

### String

The localized form of a message is called a string. If a translation is
missing on showing a message, an internationalization library can use the
message ID itself as a fallback, or a string from another locale. A string that
depends on values has to specifiy how these values (time, date, and numbers)
need to be displayed as part of this string.
